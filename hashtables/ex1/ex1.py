# goal is given a list of integers and a target, find the indices of two numbers that add up to total the target.
# ```
# input: weights = [ 4, 6, 10, 15, 16 ], length = 5, limit = 21
# output: [ 3, 1 ]  # since these are the indices of weights 15 and 6 whose sum equals 21.  The index that corresponds to the higher number should be listed first.  Here, 15 is higher than 6, so the index of 3 is listed first in the output.
